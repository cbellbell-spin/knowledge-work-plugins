description: Run a full monitoring cycle right now. Searches Indeed for open roles at tracked companies, scans for company and people news, checks industry topics, and writes a fresh monitoring/digest.md. User waits while this runs — use /setup-monitoring to configure weekly background runs instead.

Load the kate-coach skill and run the full monitoring flow as defined in `references/flows.md`, Steps 1–7.

Before starting:
- If `monitoring/watchlist.md` does not exist, tell the user and set it up first: create the folder, copy from `skills/kate-coach/references/templates/watchlist_template.md`, auto-populate Funnel Companies from `user/application_history.md`, and ask for any additional Watchlist companies, Key People, and Industry Topics before running.
- If it exists, read it in full alongside `user/user_profile.md` before starting searches.

After writing the digest, summarize findings in 4-5 sentences and ask: "Anything too broad or too narrow in what I tracked?"
